# Pomodoro

This app works on React Native (iOS, Android) and web. Most of the app's code is contained in `App.tsx`.

The commands in the instructions below assume you are in the root of this repo.

### Initial Setup

- Run `npm install`. This fetches the dependencies.

### Building for Web

- Run `npm run start:web`. This compiles the TypeScript code and recompiles it whenever any files are changed.

### Building for React Native

* `npm start` - runs react native (RN) development server
* `npm start:android` - runs the Android version of the app and attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator
* Use Xcode or Android Studio to build and deploy the native app code just like you would with any other React 
Native project.
